                    <p>Hello everybody, welcome to my brand new portfolio! Building this web page
                                was one of the first homework assignments that I had to complete as part of the University
                                of Texas Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I must admit, it wasn't easy! I definitely
                                learned a lot but, I also realize that I have so much more to learn. Astonishment doesn't
                                even begin to describe how I feel about the absolute vastness of the ever changing landscape
                                of web development technologies.</p>
                                
                                <p> You may be wondering what brought me to sign up for this fast paced and rigorous educational endeavor.
                                    Well, the reasons that I enrolled are the same as when I enrolled to Texas State University
                                    where I completed a 4 year degree in environmental sciences. I did it because I am naturally
                                    curious and have a desire to pursue new experiences and learn new skills. As an Envrionmental
                                    Specialist with the City of Austin and over 6 years of experience in the industry I am
                                    finding that my interest for the work is beginning to decrease. While I remain passionate
                                    about environmental protection and while my career continues to grow at the City, I have
                                    found that my desire for something radically different is even more
                                    compelling. At this moment, web development is exactly what I am craving. It is
                                    vastly different and unknown to me. It piques my intellectual curiousity. The prospect
                                    of shifting into a career that will likely enable me to exercise more creativity, collaboration
                                    and propell me into the cutting edge of technology is what makes this potential career
                                    change so attractive.</p>

                                <p>At the moment of writing this, the path looks daunting and I can feel the pressure increasing.
                                    However, along with those feelings also comes utter excitement! When I began this journey
                                    I immediately felt relieved to be embarking on a new adventure and new challenge. It
                                    was as if something was amiss in my life and I finally just discovered it. And so, I
                                    continue to push forward, inching closer and closer to the precipice of no return.</p>

                                <p>With the skills gained in this course I aim to launch an exciting new career as a full
                                    stack web developer. Please take the time to visit my portfolio page to see the projects
                                    that I have personally developed and deployed. Also, feel free to reach out with any
                                    questions, comments or ideas. I am happy to connect and welcome collaboration. Cheers!</p>
