                    <p>Hello everybody, welcome to my brand new portfolio! Building this web page was one of the first homework
                        assignments that I had to complete as part of the University of Texas Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I must admit,
                        it wasn't easy! But, I definitely learned a lot and I also realize that I have so much more to learn. Astonishment doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about the absolute vastness of the ever changing landscape of web development technologies.</p> <p>You may be wondering what brought me to sign up for this fast paced onslaught of information. Well, the reasons that I enrolled are the same as when I enrolled to Texas State University where I completed a 4 year degree in environmental sciences. I did it because I am a curious human and have a desire to pursue new experiences and learn new skills. As an Envrionmental Specialist with the City of Austin and over
                        5 years of experience in the environmental industry I continue to grow. But, as always, the new and unknown piqued my curiousity. Web development is something very unknown to me and I believe that's what makes it so attractive. At the moment of writing this, the path looks very daunting and I can feel the pressure rising. However, along with those feelings also comes utter excitement! When I began this journey I immediately felt relieved to be embarking on a new adventure and challenge. It was as if something was amiss in my life and I finally just discovered it. And so, I continue to push forward, inching closer and closer to the precipice of no return. </p> <p>With the skills gained in this course I aim to launch an exciting new career as a full stack web developer. Please take the time
                        to visit my portfolio page to see the projects that I have personally developed and deployed. Also, feel free to reach out with any questions, comments or ideas. I am happy to connect and welcome collaboration. Cheers!</p>
